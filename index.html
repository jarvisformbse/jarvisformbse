				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<h4 class="subtitle">Jarvis for MBSE</h4>
				<div style="height:30px;"></div>
				<p>JARVIS FOR MBSE is a product developed for all the users involved in Model-Based System Engineering, also it enriches user visualization experience by extending it towards 3D visualisation using concepts of Augmented Reality.</p>
				<p>Users, irrespective of their engineering discipline would be able to create CONSENS models in the Multi-Platform Frontend editor which provides user friendly interface which can be used on devices with touch capabilities such as Surface Hub. The MultiPlatform Frontend (MPF) is easy to understand for engineers coming from all kinds of engineering disciplines. MPF provides user experience with ease in the form of recommendations. JARVIS FOR MBSE provides an intuitive and interactive modelbased approach for systems engineering with system model creation tools. It uses advanced user interaction and visualization techniques and to assist system engineers in their engineering process. All the user-designed models will be stored in the Core (Backend) and will be technically refined and developed into SysML models with CONSENS profiling using EMF. MBSE assistance powered by Artificial Intelligence assist JARVIS for MBSE in the form of recommendations for enhancing the system design based on the existing models utilising Graph Database.</p>
				<p>Most of the time user designed CONSENS models are very complex and consist of inter relations between elements and other models. The Augmented Reality aids to visualize these models by mapping it into a 3D environment by providing further clarity to the project due to its interactive functionalities. Furthermore, the models should be stored somewhere to access or manipulate them. This functionality is performed by Backend.</p>
				<p>The above-mentioned components should collaborate with each other to complete the product. JARVIS for MBSE is very useful especially during workshops and its review processes. Due to the (often) limited time within workshops it assists in easy understanding of MBSE process. In order to achieve this, a user is given the MPF editor, allowing him/her to model CONSENS models by hand drawing shapes and writing texts which are directly converted to CONSENS models instead of having to click through several menus as offered by many tools so far the same is possible even through speech. In addition, JARVIS for MBSE also supports Chatbot for user assistance.</p>

				<h1>Our Vision</h1>
				<h4 class="subtitle">Jarvis for MBSE</h4>
				<div style="height:30px;"></div>
				<p>The idea of the JARVIS for MBSE is to bring expertise from different streams collaborate and coordinate to provide a way to capture all the information from the different disciplines of model driven engineering. As every discipline has different type of models, different Concepts and Terminologies, in order to handle homogenously all, we are working on JARVIS FOR MBSE. Also, as System Engineering increases the development and Performance for Intelligent Technical System, so our product will be facilitating the efficiency.</p>

				<h2>Core</h2>
				<p>CORE is a persistent data storage and in common communication gateway between all the components.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Facilitate storage and update of all the CONSENS partial models provided by MPF</li>
					<li>Support visualization of the JSON file in SysML via EMF (Eclipse modelling framework)</li>
					</li>CORE provides a communication gateway for suggestions received from MBSE assistant to MPF users.</li>
					<li>AR can fetch CONSENS partial models from CORE via REST API and show on AR platform</li>

				<h2>AUGMENTED REALITY</h2>
				<p>AR is responsible for visualising the MBSE models in HoloLens. Functionalities that AR is going to support in the system are below:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>3D representation of the models for better visual experience of CONSENS model</li>
				  <li>Enrichment by visualizing additional information and dependencies&nbsp;</li>
				  <li>Head Mounted Displays support portability&nbsp;</li>
				  <li>Adjustment of the views according to user preferences</li>
